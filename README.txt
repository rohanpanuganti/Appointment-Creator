**README.txt**

This project was coded by both Samantha Fisher and Rohan Panuganti. We worked as a team.

I. Instructions for compiling and executing our program:

To compile our program run the following command:

   g++ Time.cpp Date.cpp Appointment.cpp AppointmentDiary.cpp User.cpp p1.cpp

To execute our program just enter the prompts as they arrise. Dates should be entered in YYYY-MM-DD format.
e.g., 2017-3-5 Times should be entered first as the hour, then the minute, then a single uppercase meridiem
character either A or P. e.g., Hr: 12 Min: 30 A/P: A.

II. Our implementation is mostly successful, but our error messages are not as descriptive as they could be.
For example, it does not give a specifc error message if the user is invalid. If we had more time we would 
carefully walk through our code and make sure all of our error messages are properly displayed and describe
what is going on in the code.
